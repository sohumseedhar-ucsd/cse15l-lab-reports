## `cd` Command With No Arguments:

* The working directory when `cd` was ran was `/home/lecture1`.
* This command resulted in no output because the `cd` command is used to change the working directory when there is a path to another directory given after the command. However, in this case no path (argument) was given, so there was no output. However, it is important to note that performing `cd` without no argument and from a directory that isn't `home` will simply take us back to `/home`. This change would be represented by `(base) sohum@Sohums-MacBook-Pro-280 lecture1` being changed to `(base) sohum@Sohums-MacBook-Pro-280 ~ %`. 
* As a result, the ouptut was not an error and NO output is what we expected we to see.
