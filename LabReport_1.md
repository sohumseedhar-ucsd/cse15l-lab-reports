* The working directory when `cd` was ran was `/home`
* This command resulted in no output because the `cd` command is used to change the working directory when there is a path to another directory given after the command. However, in this case no path (argument) was given, so there was no output.
* As a result, NO output is what we expected we to see.   

## CD Command With a Path to a Directory as an Argument:

* The working directory when `cd lecture1/` was ran was `/home`
* This command did not produce an output but the `cd lecture1/` command changed the working directory to `/home/lecture1`. While there is not output, the command line reflects this change by changing `[user@sahara ~]$` to `[user@sahara ~ /lecture1]$`. 
* This output was not an error and what we expected we to see.
